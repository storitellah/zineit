# PROMPT.md — ZineIt v2.0 build record

This file documents the prompt and requirements that produced ZineIt v2.0, so the build
can be reproduced, audited, or extended.

---

## Full build prompt (v2.0)

> Update the zine and photobook builder with a stronger editing interface, better preview
> layout, improved image handling, and complete testing before rendering.
>
> **Text Editor tab** — all text used inside the zine editable from one place: zine title,
> page titles, captions, quotes, participant names, participant bios, reflections, project
> notes, credits, back cover text, copyright text, page number text, custom blocks. Each
> item shows page number, spread number, content type, editable field, live preview link,
> save status.
>
> **Double-page spread** — one photo spans two facing pages, aligned across the centre
> fold, centre fold guide, bleed across the gutter when enabled, safe-margin crop preview,
> crop adjustment without stretching, and a way back to single-page mode.
>
> **Facing page preview** — left and right pages always appear together, spreads never
> shown as isolated pages, preview reflects page flow, page number toggle.
>
> **Preview panel layout** — reduce preview size, centre it, enlarge the timeline, larger
> thumbnails, zoom controls (fit-to-screen, 100%, spread view).
>
> **Timeline** — page + spread thumbnails, page numbers, drag-and-drop reorder, selected
> highlight, double-spread / text / photo / audio indicators, empty page warning.
>
> **Image placement** — fix Shift+drag repositioning; quick drag placement; drag from
> library, timeline, and between frames; snap into layout frames.
>
> **Fit / Fill / Centre** — instant; aspect ratio always preserved; Fill crops, never
> stretches.
>
> **Resizing** — 8 handles (4 corners + 4 edges); resize crops, never stretches; photo
> stays centred unless repositioned; crop preview during resize; reset crop; reset frame.
>
> **Margins & guides** — margin / safe area / bleed / gutter / centre fold / grid guides,
> snap-to-guide, toggles; images stay inside margins by default, warning when crossed,
> controlled ⅛″ spill only when bleed mode is enabled, never accidental spill past the
> print-safe area.
>
> **Navigation** — next/previous page, next/previous spread, keyboard arrows, updates
> preview + timeline, never skips, never breaks on covers.
>
> **Page numbers** — separate toggles for preview and print export.
>
> **Deliverables** — GitHub repo, updated HTML (zine + photobook builders), PROMPT.md,
> README.md, CHANGELOG.md, testing report. Test the entire tool before rendering.

## Project requirements (carried through all versions)

- Fully local, standalone `index.html` — no build step, no server, works by double-click.
- Branding: **ZineIt by Storitellah** (storitellah.com); support links to
  ko-fi.com/kiberastories, patreon.com/c/kiberastories, and M-Pesa 0711 254 986.
- Zine formats: mini zine (8-page one-sheet with fold/cut imposition), quarter,
  half-letter, A5. Photobook formats: 8×8, 8×10, 10×8, A4. Front + back covers always.
- Full-resolution photo import; drag/resize/reposition; PDF download and highest-quality
  print via the browser print engine (`@page` at exact trim size, margins none, 100%).
- Verified local backups (`.bak` passes a test restore before download), autosave,
  daily backup reminder, live clock, insertable date stamps.
- 40 Google Fonts with offline system-stack fallback; lively colour system with a
  neutral canvas so photographs read true.

## Version notes

- **v1.0** — core layout engine (inches → pixels at render time), formats, templates,
  snap grid, backups, print/PDF, mini-zine imposition.
- **v1.1** — colour system, 40-font picker, keep-aspect-ratio placement, lightbox,
  in-frame photo panning, architecture docs + Phase-2 sync API scaffold.
- **v2.0** — this build: facing-page spreads, double-page spread photos, Text Editor tab,
  enlarged timeline with reorder + indicators, zoom controls, 8-way resize with live crop
  ghost, guides & bleed system with margin warnings, full navigation, page-number
  toggles, page audio notes, v1→v2 migration, automated jsdom test-suite (43 tests).

## Feature list (v2.0)

Layout · spreads: single/spread view, centre fold guide, double-page spread photos
stored once and rendered on both pages (editor, preview, print, imposition), gutter
bleed, cross-fold element transfer while dragging.
Text: Text Editor tab (page, spread, content type, live preview link, save status),
13 content roles, zine title sync, add-to-cover.
Images: full-res import, library/timeline drag sources, drop-on-frame replacement,
snap-into-empty-frame, Fit/Fill/Centre, reset crop/frame, Shift-or-Alt-drag and Pan-mode
panning, 8-way resize, live crop ghost + crop % readout, lightbox.
Guides: margins, safe area, bleed, fold, grid, snap; bleed mode (hard clamp at trim when
off, exactly ⅛″ when on); margin-crossing warnings.
Navigation: page/spread buttons, arrow keys (navigate unselected, nudge selected),
timeline click, no skips, covers safe.
Timeline: 96 px thumbs grouped by spread, page numbers, drag-reorder, ⇔/▣/T/♪/empty
indicators.
Output: sequential print/PDF at trim size, page-number print toggle (covers skipped,
outer corners), 8-panel mini-zine imposition with fold instructions.
Data: autosave, verified .bak backup/restore, v1 migration, page audio notes
(editor-only).

## Known fixes in this build

1. **Shift+drag pan** — selection no longer rebuilds the page DOM on pointerdown
   (`updateSelectionDom` mutates classes/handles in place), so the pressed node
   survives and the pan drag tracks; a Pan-mode button gives a modifier-free path.
2. **Timeline crash on the cover spread** — painting spread halves dereferenced a null
   left page (`{left:null,right:0}`); found by the automated suite, guarded.
3. **Cross-fold transfer was dead code** — per-page clamping ran before the transfer
   check; dragging in spread view now clamps in spread space so elements can cross the
   fold and re-home to the facing page.
4. **Spread halves hung off the paper in single view** — `#page` now clips at the trim.
5. **Invalid CSS colour token** in the page-number style, corrected.

## Testing checklist (all verified — see TESTING.md)

Text Editor tab · double-page spread (make, render, print, unmake) · facing pages side
by side · reduced/centred preview with Fit/100%/± zoom · larger timeline · Shift+drag ·
quick drag placement · Fit / Fill / Centre · 8 resize handles · resize never stretches ·
crop ghost + reset · margin clamps and warnings · bleed exactly ⅛″ · guides · forward
and backward page/spread/keyboard navigation · page-number toggles (preview + print,
covers skipped) · zine preview · photobook preview · print DOM (8 pages) · imposition
(8 panels, 4 rotated) · backup round-trip + corrupt-file rejection · v1→v2 migration ·
zero console errors.

## Future improvement notes

- True PDF generation with embedded bleed + crop marks (page size = trim + 2×⅛″).
- Booklet imposition for quarter/half-letter/A5 (saddle-stitch page pairing).
- Undo/redo history (the single JSON document model makes snapshots cheap).
- IndexedDB autosave for very large photo sets (localStorage has a ~5 MB ceiling).
- Optional cloud sync via the Phase-2 API scaffold in `server/` (see
  `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`).
- Text auto-flow between linked frames; per-role default styles.

## v2.1 build prompt (mobile + mini-zine print)

> Optimise the zine and photobook builder for mobile: fully responsive interface,
> mobile-friendly preview, touch drag and touch resize, swipe navigation between pages,
> tap to edit page blocks, a mobile toolbar, collapsible timeline and text editor
> panels, fit preview to screen, prevent layout overflow, keep facing pages readable,
> and allow switching between single-page, facing-spread, and fullscreen preview.
>
> Add a dedicated Mini Zine print mode: A4 and Letter layouts with a toggle, correct
> fold marks, correct cut marks, page order arranged for folding, print preview before
> export, browser print-to-PDF, and clear folding/cutting instructions. Export
> settings: A4/Letter, PDF export, show/hide fold guide, show/hide cut guide,
> include/hide page numbers, fit to paper, maintain margins, preserve image aspect
> ratios. Test mobile preview, touch controls, swipe navigation, both paper layouts,
> fold marks, cut marks, and PDF export before rendering.

### v2.1 version note

Delivered as above; see CHANGELOG.md for the feature breakdown and TESTING.md for the
65-test report (22 new tests, all green, no defects found in this round). Design
decisions worth knowing: the imposition is authored on a fixed 11 × 8.5″ design sheet
(4 × 2.75 by 2 × 4.25 panels) and mapped onto the chosen paper with one uniform
`scale()` — that is what guarantees "preserve image aspect ratios" by construction;
A4 output is therefore 97.3% size (limited by A4's shorter height). Swipe recognition
runs on pointer events with a 60 px horizontal / <50 px vertical threshold and yields
to element drags. The mobile breakpoint is 820 px, read from `window.innerWidth` so it
is testable in jsdom.

## v3.0 build prompt (memory, speed, formats, feedback)

> Recreate the zine to use less memory on the computer and on mobile and to always load
> photos fast. All formats of photos including HEIC should be read and imported by the
> tool. Also add an option on the tool that if anyone has experienced a bug or has any
> recommendation for improving the tool they should write an email to
> bryanjaybee@gmail.com. Create this as a new version.

### v3.0 version note

The memory problem was architectural: v1/v2 kept every photo as a base64 string inside
the project JSON — parsed at boot, re-stringified on every autosave, and rendered at
full resolution in the canvas, library, and timeline simultaneously. v3 splits storage
from display: originals live in IndexedDB as blobs (with an in-memory fallback for
private browsing), the UI renders 192 px thumbs and ~1600 px previews, and originals
are only decoded for print and the lightbox. Autosave shrinks from potentially tens of
MB to a few hundred KB; "load fast" falls out of the same design because the first
paint uses thumbnails already sitting in state. HEIC tries the browser's native decoder
first and lazily loads heic2any only on failure, so the app remains offline-capable for
every non-HEIC format. .bak files still contain everything (originals are embedded on
export), and v1/v2 autosaves and backups migrate in place. Feedback goes to
bryanjaybee@gmail.com via prefilled mailto links in the Support panel and view bar.
