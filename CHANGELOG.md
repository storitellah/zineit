# Changelog — ZineIt by Storitellah

## v3.2 — 2026-07-07
Type system + production readiness.

### Changed
- **New UI type system**: **Bebas Neue** for display (wordmark, panel headers, dialog titles) and **Source Sans** for all body text — loaded from Google Fonts as *Source Sans 3*, Adobe's current name for Source Sans Pro, with the classic name kept in the CSS stack and full system fallbacks so the tool still reads well offline. Monospace is retained where it belongs: the clock, zoom %, page readouts, and timeline tags. Source Sans is also available in the zine text-font picker.

### Added — production hardening
- **Crash guards**: boot is wrapped — a startup failure shows a readable message pointing to bryanjaybee@gmail.com instead of a blank page; uncaught errors and async rejections raise a gentle toast that names the error, reassures that work is autosaved, and routes to ✉ Feedback (throttled — never a toast storm).
- **Inline SVG favicon** (no 404s in production), **noscript** message, **version badge** in the header (so bug reports say which build), and a console version banner.
- **Accessibility**: aria-labels on all icon-only controls; `prefers-reduced-motion` disables drawer/toast animation.
- 9 new automated tests (92 total, all passing).

- **Shipped favicon set for the Cloudflare deployment**: `favicon.ico` (16/32/48 multi-size), scalable `favicon.svg`, `apple-touch-icon.png` (iOS Add-to-Home-Screen finds it at the root by convention), and 192/512 px PNGs for future PWA use — all the gradient Z mark, all cache-controlled for a week in `_headers`. No icon links were added to the HTML: browsers use the inline data-URI (which keeps a locally saved single ZineIt.html fully working), while crawlers, bookmark services, and iOS fetch the root files directly — so production logs stop showing favicon 404s.

### Notes
- The file ships readable, not minified — Cloudflare compresses on the wire (the gap is a few KB), and an auditable single file is part of ZineIt's local-first promise.

## v3.1 — 2026-07-07
Mobile platform release: seamless on Android and iOS, plus a cleaner support card.

### Changed
- **Notch & home-indicator safe**: the header, mobile toolbar, drawers, timeline sheet, toast, Edit chip, and fullscreen controls all respect `env(safe-area-inset-*)`, so nothing hides behind iPhone notches or Android gesture bars.
- **iOS dynamic-toolbar safe**: the app frame uses `100dvh` (with `100vh` fallback), so Safari's collapsing address bar never clips the timeline or toolbar.
- **No accidental zoom**: form controls are ≥16 px on mobile (stops iOS zoom-on-focus), controls use `touch-action:manipulation` (no double-tap zoom), tap highlights and iOS long-press callouts are suppressed on page elements, and `overscroll-behavior:none` keeps pull-to-refresh from hijacking canvas gestures. Pinch-zoom remains enabled for accessibility.
- **Touch drags stay glued to the finger**: pointer capture is engaged on drag start, making drag/pan/resize reliable on Android Chrome and iOS Safari even when the finger leaves the frame.
- **Single-row view bar** on phones: horizontally scrollable instead of wrapping into a tall stack.
- **Support card redesigned**: Ko-fi and Patreon are now compact icon buttons (brand-coloured, accessible labels, no raw URLs). **M-Pesa removed.**
- 8 new automated tests (83 total, all passing).

## v3.0 — 2026-07-07
Performance architecture release: less memory everywhere, photos that always load fast, every format in, and a feedback channel.

### Changed — the photo engine
- **Photos moved out of the project JSON into IndexedDB as blobs.** State now carries only metadata plus a ~15 KB thumbnail per photo, so autosave is instant and tiny regardless of how many photos a project holds, and the browser never keeps full-resolution images decoded just to draw the editor.
- **Three-tier rendering**: 192 px thumbs for the library and timeline (lazy-loaded), ~1600 px previews for the canvas (progressively hydrated — thumb appears instantly, preview swaps in), and full-resolution originals touched **only** for print/PDF and the lightbox. On a phone this is the difference between decoding megapixels and decoding kilobytes.
- **Print quality unchanged**: exports preload the untouched originals from the store before the print dialog opens.
- **.bak files remain fully self-contained** — export embeds the originals and previews, restore rehydrates the store. Old v1/v2 projects and .bak files migrate automatically: inline photos move to fast storage on first load and previews regenerate in the background.
- Deleting a photo (or starting a new project) frees its stored blobs and revokes object URLs — memory is actually reclaimed, and orphaned blobs are swept at startup.
- Imports run sequentially through one decoder to cap peak memory on mobile during multi-photo drops; decoding uses `createImageBitmap` with high-quality downscaling.

### Added
- **All photo formats import, including HEIC/HEIF** (iPhone default). Native decode is tried first (Safari handles HEIC itself); elsewhere a converter loads lazily from a CDN only when a HEIC file actually arrives — the app stays fully offline for every other format. Detection works by MIME type *and* extension, since HEIC files often arrive with no MIME type on Windows/Android.
- **Feedback channel**: "Found a bug? Have an idea?" in the Support panel and a ✉ Feedback button in the view bar — both open a pre-addressed email to **bryanjaybee@gmail.com** with the app version, format, and browser prefilled.
- 10 new automated tests (75 total, all passing).

## v2.1 — 2026-07-05
Mobile optimisation + a dedicated Mini Zine print mode.

### Added
- **Fully responsive mobile shell** (≤820 px): single-column layout, Photos/Tools panels as slide-in drawers with a tap-to-close backdrop, collapsible timeline bottom sheet, five-button mobile toolbar (Photos · Tools · Timeline · Text · Full), compact header, overflow-safe canvas.
- **Touch controls**: drag, pan, and 8-way resize on the unified pointer-event pipeline; `touch-action:none` keeps gestures on the frames; 18 px handles and larger tap targets on coarse pointers; tap-to-select with an **Edit chip** that opens the tools drawer (and focuses the text field for text blocks).
- **Swipe navigation**: horizontal swipes on the canvas step pages in single view and whole spreads in spread view; vertical gestures and element drags never trigger it.
- **Fullscreen preview** (mobile + desktop): chrome-free view with ‹ › navigation, page indicator, Esc/✕ to exit; single-page, facing-spread, and fullscreen views all switchable on mobile.
- **Mini Zine print mode**: dedicated dialog with **A4 / US Letter** paper toggle, **live print preview** of the real imposed sheet, dashed **fold marks** + printer-style edge ticks, ✂ **cut mark** across the middle two panels, show/hide toggles for both, page-number toggle, **fit-to-paper** via a single uniform scale (image aspect ratios preserved), optional ¼″ paper margin, correct `@page` size per paper for browser print-to-PDF, clipping warning when 100% doesn't fit A4, and collapsible fold/cut instructions.
- Imposition settings persist in the project (and .bak files); migration fills defaults for older projects.
- 22 new automated tests (65 total, all passing — see TESTING.md).

## v2.0 — 2026-07-05
A visual-layout-tool release: spreads, a text pipeline, and a tested render.

### Added
- **Facing-page preview**: Single/Spread view toggle; left and right pages always shown together with a centre-fold guide; pagination model (cover alone → interior pairs → back alone).
- **Double-page spread photos**: one image spans both facing pages, stored once, aligned across the fold in editor, preview, print, and mini-zine imposition; gutter bleed when bleed mode is on; one-click return to single-page mode.
- **Text Editor tab**: every text block in the zine in one list — page number, spread number, content type (13 roles: title, page-title, caption, quote, name, bio, reflection, note, credits, back-cover, copyright, page-number, custom), inline editing, "Show →" live-preview jump, per-row save status; zine title editing with add-to-cover.
- **Enlarged timeline** (178 px): 96 px page thumbnails grouped by spread, page numbers, drag-and-drop page reorder, current-spread highlight, ⇔ spread / ▣ photo / T text / ♪ audio / empty-page indicators; photos draggable from timeline thumbs onto the page.
- **Zoom controls**: Fit (capped for a calmer, centred preview), 100%, +/− stepping with a live percentage readout.
- **8-way resize** (4 corners + 4 edges) with a live **crop ghost** showing the full uncropped image extent plus a crop-% readout; Reset crop and Reset frame.
- **Guides & bleed system**: margin, safe-area, bleed, centre-fold, and grid guides with snap; bleed mode allowing a controlled ⅛″ spill past trim (hard clamp at trim when off); margin-crossing warnings on the offending sides.
- **Navigation**: prev/next page and prev/next spread buttons; arrow keys navigate when nothing is selected and nudge when something is; timeline click; covers included, no skips.
- **Page numbers**: independent preview and print toggles; covers always unnumbered; outer-corner placement.
- **Page audio notes**: attach field audio to a page (editor-only, never printed) with a ♪ timeline indicator.
- **Pan mode** button as a modifier-free alternative to Shift-drag.
- **v1 → v2 migration**: existing autosaves and .bak files load cleanly.
- **Automated test-suite**: 43 jsdom tests (`tests/run-tests.js`) covering the entire release checklist.

### Fixed
- Shift+drag photo panning (selection no longer rebuilds the DOM mid-gesture).
- Elements can now genuinely cross the fold in spread view and re-home to the facing page.
- Timeline crash when painting the cover spread (null left page).
- Spread halves no longer hang off the paper in single-page view.

## v1.1 — 2026-07-05
- Lively colour system (gradient wordmark, rainbow rule, colour-coded panels) on a neutral canvas.
- 40 Google Fonts with offline system-stack fallback.
- Keep-original-aspect-ratio placement toggle.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and optional Phase-2 sync API scaffold (`server/`).

## v1.0 — 2026-07-04
- Core local-first editor: zine + photobook formats, front/back covers, drag-drop full-resolution photos, five templates, ⅛″ snap grid, text with date stamps, live clock.
- PDF/print export at exact trim size; 8-page mini-zine imposition with fold instructions.
- Verified `.bak` backups (test-restore before download), autosave, daily reminder.
